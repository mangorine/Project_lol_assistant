# LOL assistant

## First steps

**Goal** : create an assistant that tells you the best match-up during the draft period.

- It has to predict roles of opponent during draft (ML)
- return the best champion to chose according to
  - Champion pool
  - Current draft (lane + tf + sp)
  - Elo

**Sub** :

- Look at the screen during the game and recognize ally + ennemy champion using champ icons
- Display best champs to use

**current** :

- goal : recover data for champs, matchup and games (wr, pr, etc...), aka make my own data base
